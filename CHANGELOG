4.0.0
-------

**breaking changes**

* Updated codebase to make use of php 7.4.2+ features. Package is now 7.4.2+ dependent.
* Updated exceptions that are thrown when trying to access a key in a map structure.
  This now throws an InvalidKeyException (still inheriting from JitesoftException)
  instead of a InvalidArgumentException.
* Updated exception thrown when trying to access a invalid link in a node. This
  now throws an OutOfBoundsException instead of an InvalidArgumentException.

**features**

* Added `tryGet` method to MAP interface / implementations.
  The tryGet method accepts a key and an optional default return value
  in case the key does not exist.
* Made some minor cleanup to the codebase and tests to make sure that the
  required standards are followed.
