## php-lists

A repo consisting of a few php classes and static methods to work with array-like objects implementing the ListInterface interface.  
Using a ListInterface implemented class does not make the code necessarily faster, but it might ease up the code-writing some.  
  
  
### Currently implemented classes.
The following classes are currently implemented:  
  
* `IndexedList` - a indexed list implemenataion which jut wraps the native array.
* `LinkedList`  - a indexed list implementation with a underlying linked list.
